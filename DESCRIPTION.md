v1 of gridAccess Renewable Energy Network. 
Weâ€™re alleviating energy consumers' reliance on unstable national electricity grids in developing countries. 
To do so, we need to run energy networks in parallel and in support of the main grid. 
We will also need to optimize energy transfers between these microgrids. 
To do so, the nearest prosumer should transfer to the requested consumer. 
Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to do just that. 
For V1 I have built a simple network of DERs on a grid. 
The program uses dijkstra's algorithm to transfer energy with the least dissipation possible by routing that energy on the shortest path.
